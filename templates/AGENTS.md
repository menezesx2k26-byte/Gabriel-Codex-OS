## Durable continuity
- Treat `docs/context/*` and observable Git/repository state as durable project memory.
- On resume, verify current branch/state and read the relevant context files before repeating previous work.
- Do not infer that work was lost merely because it is missing from the current conversation context.
- Record operational facts and decisions, not private chain-of-thought.
- Never place secrets or credentials in durable context.

## Handoff convention
- Update `docs/context/STATE.md` for durable state changes.
- Update `docs/context/DECISIONS.md` for durable project decisions.
- Update `docs/context/HANDOFF.md` before pausing a session, including completed work, validations, blockers, and the exact next safe action.
- Keep `docs/context/ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md` aligned with the actual completion gates.
- When resuming after interruption, reconcile these notes against Git status/history and other observable evidence before acting.
